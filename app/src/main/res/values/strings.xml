    <string name="help_game_content">
        The goal of Mine Seeker is to find all of the mines in the least amount of guesses. Clicking on a square will uncover whether that square is a mine or not, and
        how many hidden mines there are within the column and row of that square. When a mine is found, all squares in that mine\'s row and column will have their numbers
        decremented by one, as there is one less hidden mine. Once all mines are found/clicked, you completed the game and your score will be shown.\n\n
        Go to the Options screen to change the board size and the number of mines to set a high score for each configuration!
